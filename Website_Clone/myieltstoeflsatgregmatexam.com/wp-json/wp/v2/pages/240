The test primarily intends to aid graduate schools of business assess the potential of the applicants for advanced study in business and management. Nearly 900 management institutes all over the world require GMAT<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>\u00a0scores from the applicants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">The GMAT<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>\u00a0is different from most other customary examinations. The examination is entirely computer-based, and no two students get identical sets of questions. Also, students cannot skip questions. The test is scored on a maximum of 800. The GMAT<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>\u00a0Score alone cannot guarantee admission into a school. The test is only one of the major factors taken into consideration in the long process of an applicant getting admitted into a Business School he\/she desires.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">The GMAT is owned by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC). Admissions committees at graduate business schools use the scores along with undergraduate records, work experience, recommendations and other relevant criteria in evaluating candidates for admission to MBA and other business-related courses. For some courses GMAT is a prerequisite; for others it may be recommended or not required. Always check the requirements of individual institutions before applying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">The GMAT is currently a computer-based test offered at centers in the US and in many other countries. Since 2006, the GMAC has given the test question and software development to ACT Inc, and has given Pearson Vue the responsibility for delivery of the test at test centers. The latest version of the test, introduced in June 2012, includes an integrated reasoning section.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\"><strong>GMAT<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>\u00a0Test Structure<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">The GMAT has four main divisions: Analytical Writing; Integrated Reasoning; Verbal Reasoning; Quantitative reasoning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\"><strong>Analytical Writing<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">The\u00a0<strong>Analytical Writing section<\/strong>\u00a0has one essay writing task: the Argument.\u00a0The\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.majortests.com\/gmat\/argument.php\">Argument task<\/a>\u00a0presents a statement of a position. The candidate is required to analyze the logic of the given position and suggest how and where the reasoning may be faulty or require improvement. The student is given 30 minutes for this essay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">The scoring for the Analytical Writing section is on a scale of 0-6. The essay is scored by a human reader and then by a computer program (which the official GMAT website,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mba.com\/\">www.mba.com<\/a>\u00a0, refers to as an automated essay-scoring engine). If the human and computer scores differ significantly, the score is sent to a second expert reader for final evaluation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\"><strong>Integrated Reasoning<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">The\u00a0<strong>Integrated Reasoning section<\/strong>\u00a0has 12 questions to be solved in 30 minutes. The score is reported on a scale of 1-8 (intervals of 1).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">The questions involve interpretation of tabular, graphical and written information from a variety of sources. Each question is independent and may have more than one part, but one prompt may be used for more than one question. An on-screen calculator is available.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\"><strong>Quantitative Section<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">The\u00a0<strong>Quantitative section<\/strong>\u00a0has two types of multiple choice questions:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.majortests.com\/gmat\/data_sufficiency.php\">data sufficiency<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.majortests.com\/gmat\/problem_solving.php\">problem solving<\/a>. Follow the links to explore these types of math question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">There are 37 questions to be solved in 75 minutes. The level of math knowledge should be within the grasp of an 11th Grade student. However, the level of reasoning required is quite high. No calculators are allowed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\"><strong>Verbal Reasoning<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">The\u00a0<strong>Verbal Reasoning section<\/strong>\u00a0contains three types of question:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.majortests.com\/gmat\/critical_reasoning.php\">critical reasoning<\/a>;\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.majortests.com\/gmat\/reading_comprehension.php\">reading comprehension<\/a>;\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.majortests.com\/gmat\/sentence_correction.php\">sentence correction<\/a>. All questions are multiple-choice.

(The percentile rank indicates the percentage of people taking the test who performed worse than you.) The average (mean and\/or median) scores for students admitted to the 50 top ranking MBA programs is apparently 660. These are ball-park figures: it is easy enough to find the average GMAT scores for the intake in a given year to individual business schools.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">Note that as well as an overall score and a percentile, the test report includes the scores and percentiles for both the verbal and quantitative sections of the test. Sometimes a student\u2019s composite score looks very good, but shows a great disparity between the verbal and quant sections \u2013 this is unlikely to go down well with the admissions committees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">One thing is certain: the scores of those admitted to B-schools have been rising in recent years. Some people with lower scores than the average for any given school are admitted because they have other assets that add to the diversity of the school. In effect, this means that for a person with nothing outstanding to offer in terms of academic prowess or work experience, the score he or she needs to stand out from the crowd of applicants at a top ten B-school has to be 720 or more.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"frontpage_services\">\n<div class=\"sp_services_box\">\n<table border=\"5\" width=\"324%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #800000;\"><b>Important Notice<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">Each\u00a0<b>GMAT<\/b>\u00a0candidate in Nigeria is required to present a<strong>\u00a0valid international passport<\/strong>\u00a0as an identifying document<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Georgia, Palatino;\">\u00a0at the test center on the test day before he\/she will be allowed into the test room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is the GMAT\u00aeTest?
