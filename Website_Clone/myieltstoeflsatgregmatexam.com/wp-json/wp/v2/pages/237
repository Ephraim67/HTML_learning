This council recommended the development and administration of the TOEFL\u00ae test for the 1963-1964 time frame.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">The test was originally developed at the Center for Applied Linguistics under the direction of Stanford University applied linguistics professor Dr. Charles A. Ferguson.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">The TOEFL test was first administered in 1964 by the Modern Language Association financed by grants from the Ford Foundation and Danforth Foundation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">In 1965, The College Board and ETS jointly assumed responsibility for the continuation of the TOEFL testing program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">In 1973, a cooperative arrangement was made between ETS, The College Board, and the Graduate Record Examinations board of advisers to oversee and run the program.

ETS uses a highly diverse pool of raters rather than those exclusive to an applicant\u2019s country of origin, which promotes unbiased scoring. The Writing section is scored by at least two human raters in addition to automated scoring. All responses are scored anonymously to ensure fair and objective scoring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accepted TOEFL Scores<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">Most colleges use TOEFL scores as only one component in their admission process.
