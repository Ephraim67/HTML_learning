The duration for this module is usually short and concise with access to limited practice Tests. This module only focuses on part of the curriculum, majorly, the weak-points of the Test-Taker with regards to the Test. First Time Test-Takers are not advised to opt for this option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\"><strong>COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING MODULE<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">The Comprehensive Training Module is designed for multiple purposes, Test-Takers who have never taken a Test before or those who feel they need a thorough walkthrough of the Test&#8217;s curriculum. The Duration for this module is usually longer as it covers the complete syllabus of the Test Makers. Test-Takers who opt for this have access to unlimited Practise Tests as long as it is within their Training duration. Test-Takers are Tested on their First day of training to evaluate their strong points and weak points before proceeding to start the Training. This helps us manage the progress and improvements of all our Test Takers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\"><strong>SUPERPACK TRAINING MODULE<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">This training module is similar to the Comprehensive Training module in every way except that it starts with a &#8220;Foundational class&#8221; which addresses the fundamentals of the Test curriculum before starting the Training itself. This makes the module duration longer and more comprehensive. It is for Test-Takers who feel they aren&#8217;t academically sound or those that just need a refresher on the Fundamental principles, topics, and subjects (basic Mathematics and English) guiding the Syllabus of the Test.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\"><strong>CRASH TRAINING MODULE<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">The Crash Training Module is designed for Test-Takers who may have an Academic Deadline for taking a Test and submitting their score or for those who are too busy to attend the Regular Training modules. It is Planned and Prepared with respect to the Test-Taker Time Constraint and is usually shorter than all other regular training module durations. Test-Takers who opt for this Module will be charged substantially.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>AVAILABLE PROGRAMS AT THE CENTRE<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<b>+ ENTRANCE EXAMINATION PREPARATORY CLASSES (PRY 5 &amp; 6)<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">This program is organised for pupils in pry 5 and 6 preparing for entrance examination into high profile secondary schools such as Loyola Jesuit, Turkish, Graceland, etc. in a very serene, conductive and secure environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0<b>\u00a0 + JAMB PREPARATORY CLASSES<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">This is a special coaching for student who are preparing for UTME and willing to obtain above cut off marks legitimately in very serene, conducive and secure environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<b>+ WAEC \/ NECO PREPARATORY CLASSES<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">This is a special coaching for students who are preparing for WAEC or NECO (MAY\/JUNE or GCE) and are willing to obtain minimum of credit legitimately in all their subjects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<b>+ A-LEVEL, SAT, TOEFL, IELTS, GMAT AND GRE CLASSES<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">We register prospective oversea students for the above examination and thoroughly prepare them to excel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<b>+ ADULT EDUCATION<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">This package is organised specially for adult who wish to learn how to read, write and numerate or those who want to improve on their reading and writing skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>TRAINING TIME-TABLE<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are delighted to introduce to you our special extra-moral coaching branded\u00a0&#8220;Unique Tutorial Centre&#8221;\u00a0highly\u00a0effective and result oriented in a serene, conducive and secured learning environment.\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":542,"parent":72,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-64","page","type-page","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry"],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/myieltstoeflsatgregmatexam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/64","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/myieltstoeflsatgregmatexam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/myieltstoeflsatgregmatexam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/myieltstoeflsatgregmatexam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/myieltstoeflsatgregmatexam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=64"}],"version-history":[{"count":8,"href":"http:\/\/myieltstoeflsatgregmatexam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/64\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":627,"href":"http:\/\/myieltstoeflsatgregmatexam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/64\/revisions\/627"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/myieltstoeflsatgregmatexam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/72"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/myieltstoeflsatgregmatexam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/542"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/myieltstoeflsatgregmatexam.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=64"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
