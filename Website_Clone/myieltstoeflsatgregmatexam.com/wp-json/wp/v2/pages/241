The mathematics section consists of three scored sections. There are two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, as follows:<br \/>\n\u2022 One of the 25-minute sections is entirely multiple choice, with 20 questions.<br \/>\n\u2022 The other 25-minute section contains 8 multiple choice questions and 10 grid-in questions. The 10 grid-in questions have no penalty for incorrect answers because the student guessing isn&#8217;t limited.<br \/>\n\u2022 The 20-minute section is all multiple choice, with 16 questions.<br \/>\nNotably, the SAT has done away with quantitative comparison questions on the math section, leaving only questions with symbolic or numerical answers.<br \/>\n\u2022 New topics include Algebra II and scatter plots. These recent changes have resulted in a shorter, more quantitative exam requiring higher level mathematics courses relative to the previous exam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"col_w420r\">\n<table border=\"5\" width=\"422\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"412\">\n<div class=\"style14\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\"><b>SAT Preparation in Nigeria<\/b><\/span><\/div>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div id=\"layer104\">\n<p class=\"style27\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Georgia, Palatino; font-size: 12pt;\">SAT preparation is a very important step of the planning required for SAT.
