But if you want to learn the right things to do, then keep reading this post.</p>
<h1 id="095a" class="ic id fn ba ie if ig hg ih ii ij hj ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Effective tips on how to pass exams in high school</h1>
<p id="09b6" class="hc hd fn he b hf iy hg hh hi iz hj hk hl ja hm hn ho jb hp hq hr jc hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">How do you pass a test? Sometimes people have less time to study or read their books before the exam time. Below tips will help you get ready and pass exams at the last minute.</p>
<h1 id="737e" class="ic id fn ba ie if ig hg ih ii ij hj ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. Study Broad</span></strong></h1>
<p id="a332" class="hc hd fn he b hf iy hg hh hi iz hj hk hl ja hm hn ho jb hp hq hr jc hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Studying wide will always help students pass exams, you shouldn’t restrict your readings only to the school’s curriculum.</p>
<p id="c7e9" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">You don’t really know where the questions are coming from, so you simply need to read everything you see or that comes across you and then get ready for the examinations.</p>
<p id="79e7" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="he cz">2. Choose a learning environment</strong></span></p>
<p id="17dc" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Where you carry out your studies can also influence your ability to write well in exams and make good grades.</p>
<p id="0113" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is evident from the way a majority of the students prefer a certain location to the other in terms of reading or studying for exams.</p>
<p id="c269" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Some students will prefer to read in the classroom while others will always go to the library to read books.</p>
<h1 id="a37a" class="ic id fn ba ie if ig hg ih ii ij hj ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">3. Fight Fear with all your strength</h1>
<p id="fc7a" class="hc hd fn he b hf iy hg hh hi iz hj hk hl ja hm hn ho jb hp hq hr jc hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="he cz"><em class="jd">Fear kills…</em></strong></p>
<p id="1e5f" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">fear alone can cause a lot of problems during an examination. You need to make good use of the ability to overcome the fear of writing exams no matter how hard the paper is.</p>
<p id="6335" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Many students who studied hard for their exams can forget all they read in the examination hall when they allow fear to capture them.</p>
<h1 id="9e2d" class="ic id fn ba ie if ig hg ih ii ij hj ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">4. Avoid cramming for exams</h1>
<h2 id="b1e5" class="je id fn ba ie jf jg jh ih ji jj jk ik jl jm jn io jo jp jq is jr js jt iw ju gj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="jv">Ever heard about la cram la pour?</em></h2>
<p id="5d7b" class="hc hd fn he b hf iy hg hh hi iz hj hk hl ja hm hn ho jb hp hq hr jc hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is a term used to express a situation where students engage in cramming only to pass exams.</p>
<p id="a03f" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Students who cram a lot tends to forget all they have crammed after the examination period and most of the times even before the examination as little stress or distraction can make then loss what the brain holds because they didn’t study to remember. They were cramming only to write their examinations.</p>
<p id="1067" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Students who want to pass exams with good grade are advised to study hard and shun any form of cramming as this has never helped any successful student.</p>
<p id="9885" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Successful students learn to remember what they are been taught and not to cram only for exams and no nothing post examination.</p>
<h1 id="1010" class="ic id fn ba ie if ig hg ih ii ij hj ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">5. Avoid school distractions</h1>
<p id="023f" class="hc hd fn he b hf iy hg hh hi iz hj hk hl ja hm hn ho jb hp hq hr jc hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="he cz"><em class="jd">All works and no play makes Jack a dull boy…. but should Jack play away his time?</em></strong></p>
<p id="7ef6" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">We know some students despite the zeal they have for their academic pursuit, will also like to be the most popular student ever. Yet the majority of ways students tends to be popular in the college is to engage in a school party, partying from one club to the other.</p>
<p id="d9b9" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">This what an average student sees as a means to become popular in the high school, we refer to such activities as factors capable of causing distractions that will affect the student’s school grade points.</p>
<p id="080e" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">School activities like sports and school parties are organized to help students interact better with the school and environment, and meet even more people.</p>
<p id="ce43" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">This should be done moderately as it will always remain the secondary option. While studying and writing exams with flying colours will always remain the primary aim of every serious student.</p>
<h1 id="c227" class="ic id fn ba ie if ig hg ih ii ij hj ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">6. Don’t be late to exams</h1>
<p id="d1f2" class="hc hd fn he b hf iy hg hh hi iz hj hk hl ja hm hn ho jb hp hq hr jc hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="he cz"><em class="jd">Always late to school? Don’t even try it during examinations…</em></strong></p>
<p id="28c2" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Coming to school late is a thing every student is always advised to stay away from, but a majority of the students have formed it as a habit to always come to school late.</p>
<p id="cde0" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">These types of students will always have the problems of passing school exams as they are always late for school and missing too many lectures scheduled for the school session.</p>
<p id="9dca" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">During exams, coming to school late will output a very awful result as the student will be in a rush and might be given late penalties while others are busy writing their examination.</p>
<p id="7bb5" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">The above situations can disorganize a student and make him/her perform low during the examination and probably submit same time with others.</p>
<p id="cfe6" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="he cz"><em class="jd">Why are you always late to school, is there anything you can do about it?</em></strong></p>
<p id="53ac" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Find out what makes you late to school and devise a means to handle them properly, you can set alarm if you have a sleeping issue, or even increase the rate you do some domestic chores before leaving the hostel for school.</p>

<h1 id="9ba0" class="ic id fn ba ie if ig hg ih ii ij hj ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">8. Prepare a reading schedule for your studies</h1>
<p id="9194" class="hc hd fn he b hf iy hg hh hi iz hj hk hl ja hm hn ho jb hp hq hr jc hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Making a reading timetable is an effective way to make better performance during exams, this is a practical approach to reading what you intend to read at the right time.</p>
<p id="f3af" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Reading timetable will make sure you cover all the courses you’re supposed to read and get ready for your examination.</p>
<p id="04be" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">It is true that after setting your reading timetable, there could be other challenges like feeling sleepy while reading, but mastering your reading timetable will help you overcome it.</p>
<h1 id="a2d1" class="ic id fn ba ie if ig hg ih ii ij hj ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">9. Make reading a habit</h1>
<p id="c303" class="hc hd fn he b hf iy hg hh hi iz hj hk hl ja hm hn ho jb hp hq hr jc hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">There’s no specific time to start reading, the best time to start reading is now.</p>
<p id="86f2" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Some students are fond of reading only when the exam is close, there will always go short of time reading all the courses they will have to write, especially for students studying in schools with tight exam timetable.</p>
<p id="5f5a" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">You will write exams with flying colours when you make reading a habit. You can achieve this through constant reading.</p>
<h1 id="316f" class="ic id fn ba ie if ig hg ih ii ij hj ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">10. Develop a passion for your course</h1>
<p id="6ee9" class="hc hd fn he b hf iy hg hh hi iz hj hk hl ja hm hn ho jb hp hq hr jc hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Many students complain they got admission into the course they don’t like but they have to accept the admission because they are tired of staying at home.</p>
<p id="c195" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Such type of students will find it difficult to write and pass such courses excellently simply because they don’t have a passion for the course they are studying.</p>
<p id="deb7" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="jd">We hear some people say I hate mathematics, I hate physic, I hate Chemistry, name them…</em></p>
<p id="bbfe" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Developing a passion for your course is a sure way to writing exams with high grades.</p>
<h1 id="2837" class="ic id fn ba ie if ig hg ih ii ij hj ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">11. Sleep is necessary</h1>
<p id="930a" class="hc hd fn he b hf iy hg hh hi iz hj hk hl ja hm hn ho jb hp hq hr jc hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Watching motivational movies can be very interesting, but spending much time watching movies will cause you to sleep when you’re supposed to read.</p>
<p id="9524" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Again make sure you always have up to 8 hours of sleep every day, this does not matter whether you want to read throughout the night or not, you can sleep during the day and read at night. Or read in the daytime and then get yourself full hours of sleep at night.</p>
<h1 id="5e13" class="ic id fn ba ie if ig hg ih ii ij hj ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">12. Join a reading team</h1>
<p id="25b9" class="hc hd fn he b hf iy hg hh hi iz hj hk hl ja hm hn ho jb hp hq hr jc hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="he cz"><em class="jd">Reading team is a leading team…</em></strong></p>
<p id="37fa" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">The above is evident from how they are very comfortable to write exams, despite how dreadful the subject appears to you.</p>
<p id="03f6" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Find out people who like reading, and make friends with them, make sure you are punctual to your group’s reading schedule and never allow a single miss for reading</p>
<h1 id="c283" class="ic id fn ba ie if ig hg ih ii ij hj ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">13. Test yourself before exams</h1>
<p id="e6ff" class="hc hd fn he b hf iy hg hh hi iz hj hk hl ja hm hn ho jb hp hq hr jc hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">After reading, before you go for the exams, you can ask friends in your reading group to ask you certain questions within and outside all you studied and see how well you can answer those questions.</p>
<p id="eb5d" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Apart from answering questions from friends, you can also organize your own personal quiz and see how well you can attend to them you just have to be honest with yourself here.</p>
<p id="5fd2" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">If there’s anything you forget, you can always make references to your reading materials and conduct several revisions before the exam starts.</p>
<h1 id="2940" class="ic id fn ba ie if ig hg ih ii ij hj ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">14. Ask others in the higher class</h1>
<p id="9ab2" class="hc hd fn he b hf iy hg hh hi iz hj hk hl ja hm hn ho jb hp hq hr jc hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="he cz"><em class="jd">Knowing it all is very difficult…</em></strong></p>
<p id="01f9" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">You can always meet others who are in a higher class, ask them how they managed to write and pass certain university courses, follow their strategies to see how best it works for you.</p>
<p id="de29" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">They were once at your stage, now they have passed it, the possibility that things will work out for you same as it did for them is high.</p>
<h1 id="26aa" class="ic id fn ba ie if ig hg ih ii ij hj ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">15. Read and study past questions</h1>
<p id="1dbd" class="hc hd fn he b hf iy hg hh hi iz hj hk hl ja hm hn ho jb hp hq hr jc hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Most of the exams you are yet to write have been written by some other persons, some time ago…</p>
<p id="3a49" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">You can download past questions online, or ask others who have written to give you their question papers so you can go through them.</p>
<p id="1937" class="hc hd fn he b hf hw hg hh hi hx hj hk hl hy hm hn ho hz hp hq hr ia hs ht hv dm gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Reading past questions will help you know the scheme or strategies adopted in setting a particular school exam and the approaches you can apply to make high grades.</p><p>The post <a href="http://myieltstoeflsatgregmatexam.com/2021/06/03/15-effective-tips-on-how-to-pass-exams-with-high-best-grades/">15 Effective Tips On How To Pass Exams With High Best Grades</a> first appeared on <a href="http://myieltstoeflsatgregmatexam.com">IELTS, TOEFL, GRE, SAT, GMAT, PTE Exam Registration and Lecture Centre in Nigeria - UNIQUE EDU CONSULT</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Studying effectively is not a matter of chance. Educators and psychologists have researched study methods for years. Some of the best studies come from the top universities: Stanford, Indiana, and Chicago where precise experiments with student groups have shed light on the most effective study methods. Students who follow these methods learn more easily, retain material for longer periods of time, and save themselves hours of study time. The ten study methods researchers have found that work are:</p>
<h3>1. Making and Keeping a Study Schedule</h3>
<p>Set aside certain hours of each day for study just as you do for nourishment and sleep. Keep the same schedule faithfully from day-to-day. The amount of time needed for study will vary for each individual based on skills with the subject matter. An average of two hours of study each day for each hour in class is recommended. Going to class is only the beginning; the real work begins afterwards!</p>
<h3>2. Studying in an Appropriate Setting — Same Time, Same Place, Every Day</h3>
<p>If concentration is your problem, then the right surroundings will help you greatly. Your study desk or table should be in a quiet place – free from as many distractions as possible. You will concentrate better when you study in the same place every day. It’s a mind set. For example, when you sit down at the kitchen table, you expect to eat. When you sit down in an easy chair, you watch TV, etc. Developing the habit of studying in the same place at the same time everyday will improve your concentration.</p>
<h3>3. Equipping Your Study Area With All the Materials You Need</h3>
<p>Your study desk or table should be equipped with all the materials you might need to complete the assignment, e.g., pencils, pens, erasers, paper clips, stapler, dictionary, snacks, and liquid refreshments, etc. For some assignments, you may require a calculator or other supplies. With your materials at hand, you can study without interruption. If you have an answering machine, let it do its job during your study time. You can return the calls after you have finished studying. Taking your snack food and drinks to the study location will eliminate those endless trips to the kitchen which break your concentration.</p>
<h3>4. Not Relying on Inspiration for Motivation</h3>
<p>Can you imagine an athlete-in-training waiting for inspiration to strike to practice in preparation for an event? Of course not. They train daily to stay competitive whether they want to or not. Like the athlete, you must get in training for tests and examinations by doing the assignments and preparing daily through review to be ready for the action.</p>
<h3>5. Keeping a Well-Kept Notebook Improves Grades</h3>
<p>Researchers tell us that there is definitely a relationship between orderliness and high grades. Knowing where to find your materials when you need them is crucial. Keep a special section for each subject in your notebook as well as a semester calendar so that you can write down all important assignments as they are announced. Having all of this information together in one place is vital to your success. A well-kept notebook is a part of good time management. If you’ve ever misplaced an important assignment, you know how much valuable time can be lost looking for it.</p>
<h3>6. Keeping a Careful Record of Assignments</h3>
<p>Put it down in black and white—including the details—and keep it in your notebook. Knowing just what you are expected to do and when you are expected to do it is the first giant step toward completing important assignments successfully and on time.</p>
<h3>7. Making Use of “Trade Secrets”</h3>
<p>Flash cards aren’t just for kids! They are a legitimate study tool. Use the front of the card to write an important term, and on the back, write a definition or an important fact about that term. Carry your flash cards with you. Use them during “dead time,” such as standing in a check-out line, waiting in a doctor or dentist’s office, riding a bus, or waiting at the Laundromat. Keep a set in the glove compartment of your car for long lines at your favorite fast food drive-in restaurant or bank. Post them on your bathroom mirror to review while shaving or applying make-up. You’ll be surprised how much you can accomplish during those otherwise “dead times.” Think about developing your own “trade secrets” that will improve your study skills.</p>
<h3>8. Taking Good Notes as Insurance Against Forgetting</h3>
<p>Learn to take good notes efficiently as your instructors stress important points in class and as you study your assignments. Good notes are a “must” for just-before-test-reviewing. Without notes, you will need to reread and review the entire assignment before a test. This may require you to read anywhere from 100-300 pages of material in one sitting. With notes, you can recall the main points in just a fraction of the time. The time you spend in note taking is not lost, but in fact, is a time-saver.</p>
<h3>9. Overlearning Material Enhances Memory</h3>
<p>Psychologists tell us that the secret to learning for future reference is overlearning. Experts suggest that after you can say, “I know this material,” that you should continue to study that material for an additional one-fourth of the original study time. The alphabet is an example of overlearning. How did you learn it? Probably through recitation which is the best way to etch material into the memory trace. Manipulate the material as many different ways as possible by writing, reading, touching, hearing, and saying it. In an experimental study, students who overlearned material retained four times as much after a month than students who didn’t overlearn.</p>
<h3>10. Reviewing Material Frequently</h3>
<p>A student who does not review material can forget 80% of what has been learned in only two weeks! The first review should come very shortly after the material was first presented and studied. Reviewing early acts as a safeguard against forgetting and helps you remember far longer. Frequent reviews throughout the course will bring rewards at test time and will alleviate pre-test anxiety.</p>
<p>Although these ten study methods do work, there is one other component needed when using all of them – taking responsibility for studying by following through on assignments. All the study methods in the world won’t help you if you don’t help yourself. As with most everything in your life, your motto should be, <strong>“I’m responsible for my success!”</strong></p>
<p>If you put forth the effort to study effectively, the improved skills will soon become a habit and be just as natural as breathing. The result can be better grades, greater knowledge, and higher self-esteem. These skills will also serve you well in your professional and personal life.</p><p>The post <a href="http://myieltstoeflsatgregmatexam.com/2021/06/03/ten-study-methods-that-work/">Ten Study Methods That Work</a> first appeared on <a href="http://myieltstoeflsatgregmatexam.com">IELTS, TOEFL, GRE, SAT, GMAT, PTE Exam Registration and Lecture Centre in Nigeria - UNIQUE EDU CONSULT</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taking the TOEFL is almost always a stressful experience. You need to get a specific score. You pay a lot to take the test. You’ve been preparing for months. The test center may be noisy or crowded. You might not have slept well the night before.</p>
<p>There’s nothing to be done about any of that, but beginning to prepare for the TOEFL well in advance is one of the best things you can do to reduce your level of stress on test day. Here are 5 TOEFL preparation strategies that I have found effective:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Become a good note taker</strong>: During the TOEFL, you only get to listen to audio clips once. You will then have to answer questions, speak, or write on the subject you heard about. Because you cannot replay the audio, you need to become a good note taker. You can practice taking notes in your native language or in English. It is probably best to do some of both. Your goal is to learn to take notes in real time, without missing anything the speaker is saying. Try with a variety of different audio clips of different lengths and levels of complexity, then listen to the clip again and see how accurate your notes are. Pay attention to things that may seem elementary like the layout of your notes and the legibility of your handwriting. Being able to take notes confidently and record all the important pieces of information in real time will be a huge help to you on your TOEFL test, but also in your future studies.</li>
<li><strong>Take practice tests</strong>: When you’re preparing for the TOEFL, you’re almost always aiming for a specific score. During your TOEFL preparation period, you can only know if you’re nearing your objective by taking practice tests. Practice tests will also help you get a feeling for the test environment, question types, and constraints you’ll be faced with on test day.</li>
<li><strong>Read every day:</strong> Even native English speakers build their vocabularies by reading. The more broadly you read, the more exposure you get to concepts and vocabulary. The more closely you read, the more you build your reading comprehension skills. Read broadly and closely to expand the range of subjects you are comfortable with in English. You never know what subjects will come up on your TOEFL test, so it’s best to have a very wide comfort zone.</li>
<li><strong>Listen to podcasts:</strong> There is a lot of English-language talk radio online, whether you like the BBC or NPR, comedy or news. Listening to native English speakers speaking English at their natural speed will develop your listening comprehension. You can also develop your speaking skills by playing back parts of the podcast and trying to mimic the pronunciation of the speaker. Understanding a recording is harder than understanding a video because there aren’t the same context clues. That makes podcasts better for listening comprehension practice than watching movies or TV shows in English.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to touch type:</strong> The writing section of the exam requires you to type your answers on an unfamiliar computer with a QWERTY keyboard. If you spend all your time struggling with the keyboard, you’re not going to have much time left to write a good essay. It seems like a simple skill, but many people forget to prepare for it. Make sure you can type quickly in English on a QWERTY keyboard well before your test date. There are lots of free online tools to help you learn touch typing.</li>
